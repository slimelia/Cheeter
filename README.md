# Cheeter
Cheeter generates HTML posts for the website Cohost.org

## Usage
Visit https://slimelia.github.io/Cheeter/ to generate Cheets.

## Rationale
Cohost is more akin to Tumblr than Twitter. Short text posts look sparse and out of place. The lack of character limits can be daunting for users just wishing to jot down a few short sentences.

Cheets are designed to allow a way to semantically denote short-form text posts, akin to Twitter. The generator has an (admittedly easily bypassable) character limit to simulate the experience of Twitter-like platforms. The simplistic design of Cheets tries to highlight short-form text posts and make them more compact & easily digestible.
